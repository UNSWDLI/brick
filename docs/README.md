# brick: Documentation

## Overview

The collection of content in this path is intended to serve as an initial
"starter pack" of documentation for the `brick` application. At some future
point we hope to host the documentation elsewhere in a more accessible way.

## Project home

See [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/atc0005/brick) for the latest code,
to file an issue or submit improvements for review and potential inclusion
into the project.
