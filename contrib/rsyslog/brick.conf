# Purpose: Config snippet for rsyslog to route syslog messages to a dedicated
# log file


# Scenario:
#
# 1) Log messages generated by brick are sent to stdout
# 2) systemd captures stdout messages
# 3) rsyslog pulls messages from systemd via imuxsock or imjournal rsylog
#    input modules
# 3) rsyslog routes messages to a dedicated local log file (due to this config
#    snippet)
# 4) logrotate later rotates this dedicated local log file

# route `brick` messages to a dedicated file, prevent those same messages from
# being logged elsewhere to locations specified *after* this config snippet is
# processed. If this snippet is read by rsyslog after other log destinations
# are set you may still see duplicate log messages.
